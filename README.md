## Inspiration
We were inspired by our non-existent ability to write love poems

## What it does
It generates a love poem for you to share with your loved ones. It also features old English so you can also sound smart and your poem can sound exquisite.

## How we built it
We built a python function (backend) that generates a love poem using sample love poems, then connected it to a website using Flask.

## Challenges we ran into
We had to learn Flask because we started the project without knowing that you can't directly connect a python program to a website

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Learning Flask

## What we learned
Flask

## What's next for CreateMyLovePoem.Online
