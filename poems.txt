a bed will sing

a bitter-sweet sways here and there my mind,

a child

a diction-ary,

a dried bone called jericho

a gentle heart, or purge or make it wise,

a hand to free it that obeys the mind,

a heart of flaming sulphur, flesh of tow,

a homeland we swallow without water

a lamp will lament

a little flame consumed and fed on me

a moon,

a mouth the taste of wine, close-cropped hair

a mustard seed!!,

a new language springs up,

a prey for burning beauty to devour,

a ring or a bracelet,

a sightless mind that weak and lame doth go

a single andulus that we possess,

a sudden pardon comes to set him free,

a worm is born, that dying noiselessly

about the peace of selling by installments,

about the peace of the cowards??

about the peace of the dead,

acquiring higher worth for endless days--

add beauteous art, which, brought with us from heaven,

after a long separation

after fifty years,

after fifty years,

after this secret flirtation, in oslo

after trying many years, and then

against the ages of repression

against the institutionalization of the desert,

against the kings of salt,

all my fair hours are turned to miseries

all that is in you is princely

all the signatures of oslo will not equal

all the songs of heroism fell,

all the trees

all through the day she'd clasp me! would i were

all were made in america,

amid the gloom where only sad thoughts reign,

amid the heavenly host to take her throne,

among a thousand proofs let one suffice,

an a

an image living in the alpine stone,

an inn called palestine,

an onion,,

and a b,

and a blue sea,

and a bundle of songs

and a hand without fingers,

and a white crescent,

and all of a sudden we found ourselves

and all the questioners,

and almost at the end of her career,

and assassinated all questions,

and at the close of your life

and at the end of the fast, they threw to us,

and be imprisoned

and bears the name of love,

and birds appear in the distance

and chewed our livers,

and clasp the bosom that it serves to lace,

and death may follow both upon their flight;

and fires of paradise--less fair than these,

and fled from all languages,

and flocks of swallows

and followed me,

and frozen exhalations sinks my sun,--

and haven offered her who is in fear,

and he who fain would find it, first must die,

and he who looks on beauty with sad cheer,

and her gypsy and crazy love of life

and his chest, his throat, enough for you

and his eyes, a shore of purity

and his waist, the sway of a branch

and i am like a child in his hands

and i an old man in my evening burn,

and i be undeluded, unbetrayed,

and i have no experience

and i hope i change not,

and i return,i return to my table

and i shall continue to love you until the world flood arrives;

and i, when i love you,

and if another gives you a ship

and if i ceased, then i would not be i,

and in the song of every nightingale

and infancy, innocence

and its stars

and knowest that i know thou knowest me,

and like a chestnut tree

and love may commit suicide

and men shall say, 'for her 'twas wise to pine,'

and my madness,

and never left,

and nothing shames us,

and now perchance hath made me weep outright,

and nubian drums beat,

and of me say the fools,

and of me say the fools,

and only anger could break and untie it,

and over their lips i become

and purity,

and raced to kiss the boots of the murderers,,

and renting by installments,

and return an exhausted bird,

and ride into the sun upon my horse,

and saw her tear traversing the ocean's waves,

and since thine eyes all paradise enshrine,

and sleep in my eyes,

and spread sails,

and still his arrow at base quarry flies,

and stood in lines, like sheep before the guillotine

and stop time in your eyes

and sure i am thine eyes this mischief breed,

and sure i am thine eyes this mischief breed,

and that fair woven net of gold refined

and that i am equal to thousands of stars

and that i am treasure, and that i am

and the ages

and the apricots, and the mint,

and the black rain in my eyes

and the cyclone

and the deals,

and the kiss more important than the lips,

and the lanterns of the mosques,

and the marines' music,

and the merchants, and the exploiters?

and the olives, and the oil,

and the poems in my notebooks

and the streets' cobbles,

and the walls,

and the wedding spread, and the flowers, and the candles,

and the wives, and the children,

and there is no man to rescue the heavenly symbol

and there is no manliness,

and they call for my hanging,

and think of you

and to love dreamers i become

and triumphs over nature, i, who strive

and we danced,

and we drank, and we danced,

and we entered god's paradise,

and we rejoiced,

and we remembered all that we retain of the love poetry,

and we were blessed with the signing of the peace of the cowards,

and we were expelled to the sidewalks of sorrow,

and we were fair,

and we were married without love,

and were amazed,

and who proposes to her

and wipe away the line

and with a new language

and you, like marble, lady without peer,

and your tears will flow like a river

and, for us, they do not last so long,

and, like the face it worships, fades away,

antioch fell,

are full of roses and melodies

are greater and more important than both of us,

around her beauteous bosom in such bliss!

around her golden hair so deftly twined,

as hallows and makes pure all gentle hearts,

as heat from fire, from loveliness divine

as pen and ink alike serve him who sings

as the purged soul from hell returns with praise,

as the same stone hath shapes both rich and vile

as though to be the first her brows to kiss!

be this what this may be, 'tis this i seek,

because about the matters of my beloved

because in thee i love, o my loved lord,

become fields of mimosa and poppy,

behold the beams that from thy beauty flow;

belongs to him who strives with every nerve,

between water and fire

birds fly from your eyes with tiding of honey,

blow rains of melodious lights,

blue,

blue,

bones of dry wood, a soul without a guide

bound round her waist, saith, here i'd ever cling,--

break down the wall that stands 'twixt me and thee;

breathing the fragrance of the sea

burning as burns the phoenix ere it dies;

burning unto those orbs of light i run,

burns a fresh heart with swift consuming fire,

burns in your presence, in your absence dies?

but beauty and the starlight of her eyes,

but despite all its pains,

but far within, where all is holy ground,

but gathered

but ill befits a heart all manly wise,

but never have i read a cup similar to yours

but never have i seen sorrows similar to yours

but she saw her picture broadcasted over all channels,

but since the laws of heaven immortalise

but what my face shows--dark imaginings,

but your sky will be rain-filled

but, in chaste hearts uninfluenced by the power

but, lady, feet must halt where sight may go,

by god, if you even croaked a letter,

by long experience? shapes that seem alive,

by too great splendor is his name attended;

can draw forth only death to feed on me,

cannot discover anything but death,

cannot pursue an angel in her flight,

caravans ride from your breasts carrying indian herbs,

cause my mischance, nor fate, nor destiny;

centuries hence when both are buried, thus

charms,which no book has contained

choice soul, in whom, as in a glass, we see,

clasp in these yearning arms and keep for aye

cleanse me from this spell

clogged with mortality and wingless, we

close-hidden in my heart, may temper me,

cocoons of silk

concealed in excess, but will still require

conceive another form of air or clay,

conquer the mother tongue,

contained in a bottle, if you smashed it,

contemplating the upturned cup

deliver me from this atheism,

descends a glorious light

desiring her lover

despite the sadness

despite the wind

despoils itself to clothe fair limbs, and be

dizzy suns and sails

do not ask about his lips,as elegant as the sunset

do not ask me, the name of my love

do not look for it here in my chest

do not say my love was

do not say my love was

do not say, why did this youth

doth not include, to break the marble spell

drag me,to the depths

drawing our better thoughts with pure appeal

drowning you, in spilled scent

drowning,

each blossom pressing forward from behind,

each word, each smile of her would i have won,

e'en so the fire struck from my soul, that lay

enclosed together, and my worthless brain

eternal to a brief and hollow truce,

even as the stag or lynx or leopard flies

every conception that a man can find

every time i kiss you

except the mirage,

fail the least part of their firm love to tell,

fair soul, in whom love, pity, piety,

falls in torrents, torrents

false hope belongs unto that love alone

fell,

finding her sooner, if 'tis age alone

fire-hardened i shall live eternally;

fixed be that moment on the dial of heaven!

flying where now sad age all flight denies,

fondness will remain my calling,

for ever faster flies her beauteous foe,

for fifty years they starved our children

for from the stars above

for he who fain a seraph would pursue

for hearts that shrink or swell, alike will break,

for i am filled with desire,from my

for i don't know how to swim

for if of our affections none find grace

for in thy sight what could i do but pine?

for i've avenged the blood of each slain woman

for long have i studied fortune-telling

for long have i studied fortune-telling

for loving thee what license is more plain

for my pure love, prithee let them suffice,

for our instruction; then to god ascended;

for pain in prison pent hath double woe,

for rays of god's own grace to enter in,

for she was born with god in paradise;

for so i love thee, lady, and my strain

--for the fiftieth time--

--for the fiftieth time--our virginity,

for the veins of pride have dried within us,

for, lacking thee, so low my state is brought,

for, truth to tell, who trusts not is a liar,

free through the eyes; while prisoned here below,

from different germs take divers qualities

from happy tears to woeful smiles, from peace

from heaven on high to make our earth divine,

from the arabs' hands,

from the swift-footed feebly run the slow!

from whom they took away the tears??

gains doubtful hope and certain miseries,

gilt at the tips, so sweetly doth it ring

glory to god

glory to that eternal peace is paid,

good news and bad may bear the self-same knife;

grammarians and linguists?

grass grows on my tongue

greatens their brilliance

grenada fell

had i but earlier known that from the eyes

had i told the sea

half of the dowry was in dollars,

has no land, no home, no address

have found a home, as from thy outward state

have i sinned?

have power both smitten breasts to pierce and thrill;

he builds castles of fantasies

he carries for me seven moons in his hands

he carries me with him, he carries me

he fashioned me to see thee as thou art--

he gives me sun, he gives me summer

he lets me listen, when he moves me,

he plants me, in a distant cloud

he takes me, from under my arms

he tells me that i am his treasure

he tells me things that make me dizzy

he who approaches her garden wall

he who for seed sows sorrow, tears, and sighs,

head to my feet

health and content, heart's ease and peace of mind

heaven opened wide to him its portals splendid,

heaven, if it heed our lives, can hardly bless

help me,so i can be healed of you,

help me,to leave you

her eyes are so beautiful

her flight aloft nor e'er to earth decline;

her mouth and her laughter

his hope is treacherous only whose love dies

history fell from the arabs' hands,

hittin fell without a fight,

hold possibilities of every kind;

how can a nation cry,

how can he use old words?

how can that be, lady, which all men learn

how difficult it is, my son

how have i fallen!--when 'tis truth we lose,

how shall he fare who must ere long expire,

how tears may die in the eyes

how then, ah woe is me! shall that chaste fire,

how to cut the roots of your love from the depths

how we dreamed of a green peace,

i am breathing under water!

i am drowning,

i am putting a hurried love letter

i am,

i become liquid light

i become time outside all time,

i blame the mistress i was born to serve,

i cannot by the utmost flight of thought

i conquer the world with words,

i deemed upon that day when first i knew

i desire you,so teach me not to desire

i do not resemble your other lovers, my lady

i entered the lodges of women

i fear for you, from the fragrance of perfume

i feel

i feel that i am the king of time

i forget about the sky,

i give you rain

i have left it to run with the sunset

i have no stronger sureties than these eyes

i know not if it be the fancied light

i know not if it be the longed-for light

i know not if my heart bred this disease,

i light the coming age

i might have drawn new strength my race to run,

i never killed,

i never stole,

i never traded

i possess the earth and everything on it

i run on the scattered rocks like a child

i said nothing

i see the lovely images, hers, as

i seek the splendour in thy fair face stored;

i shall continue to love you untill the world flood arrives,

i shall give you the journey,

i stretch out on the shore

i sweep away the beginning of things

i violated god's commands,

i will give you the trees

i will write of my belovedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s matters

i won't breath his name, my lover,

i won't claim love's to blame for this, or chance,

i would furl my sails each evening

i would not have began

i, in broad day, have loved,

i, poetry, compose,

if

if at all, the high and new come slowly,

if both be governed by one life, one will;

if each the other love, himself forgoing,

if either at the other's grief despond,

if fortune bind both lovers in one bond,

if god himself thus rules my destiny,

if i am dear to you

if i knew,,

if i knew,how i would end,

if i was made for art, from childhood given

if in the name of my beloved i chant,

if in two bodies one soul triumph still,

if it be love of loveliness divine,

if it is real, this sweet expectancy,

if joy or pain be more, the sight

if love be chaste, if virtue conquer ill,

if love in one blow and one golden arrow

if love should slay me, for i am love's champion

if love to only mid-day be allowed,

if love with one blow and one golden wand

if one chaste love, if one divine compassion,

if one destiny is equal for two lovers,

if one hard fate of the one is felt by the other,

if one soul in two bodies makes itself eternal,

if one spirit, if one will guides two hearts;

if only somebody'd give me a boat,

if only, if only i were a sailor,

if sense finds only sense in what it sees?

if some mild heat of love in youth confessed

if the mere lapse of lengthening years hath pressed

if the one loves the other and neither loves himself,

if the undying thirst that purifies

if then my heart cannot endure the blaze

if they are true, these hopes that from thee flow,

if thousands of these thoughts, all thought outgoing,

if through the eyes the heart speaks clear and true,

if you are my friend,

if you are prophet,

if you are strong,

if you were at the level of my madness,

if your eyes had not been, what would the world have been?

if, lost to hope and chilled in every vein,

if, made mere smoke and dust, i live to-day,

ignore what people say

i'll say that mercy and annihilation both

in a dung heap!!,,

in a guarded palace

in a red mailbox,

in either way, by colour or by stone,

in every capital i, her, plant,

in hashish,

in high or low or intermediate style;

in its true worth by death alone divined,

in love,and no boat,

in love's high house, would prove more kindly-wise,

in my green age, now that the wood is dry,

in my homeland

in sight of heaven, then wherefore hath god made

in spite of time and death, those tyrants stern,

in that glad angel's face, so full of rest,

in the blue harbor of your eyes

in the blue harbor of your eyes

in the blue harbor of your eyes

in the blue harbor of your eyes

in the blue harbor of your eyes

in the blue harbor of your eyes,

in the closed book of your eyes?

in the flutter of butterflies

in the giving of a generous cloud

in the hands of the romans, then what are we defending?

in the ocean, in the breathing of dales

in the skyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gold,

in the summer

in the tears of winter, when winter cries

in thee, and with chaste fires our soul sustain?

in thee, fair lady, proud, ineffable,

in thy fair face, and feel the sting thereof,

invisible to the eye

is a martyr

is all the hand that serves the brain can do,

is an open sea window,

is in the stone itself, already there

is that when you laugh,

is the daring and headstrong,

is the soul's thirst that far beyond it lies,

it burns the stone, and from the ash doth raise

it cries if i cry,

it happened with marvelous ease

it is an act of rape!!,,

it is love, my son

it is not a reconciliation,

it leaves the heart all soft and infantine

it would have left its shores,

its commas be on the verge of flight

its fish,

its letters from longing will turn green

its shells,

kiln-hardened this resists both frost and sun,

kind to the world, but to itself unkind,

laughs if i laugh

leaving i know not what that wounds and heals,

lest joy so poignant slay a soul so weak,

let my whole body be one eye to see,

let then thy beauty, to preserve my life,

let time stand still, and let noon's chariot stay;

lie down with

lies hidden, but the art i wield so well

lifting both to heaven with a single wing,

light is more important than the lantern,

like a feather carried by the wind

like a spring flowing from the ground,

like all prophets,

like dust by winds kind in their cruelty,

like fish,

like others

like pills of aspirin!!,

like the fuse of a bomb,

like writing with jasmine water,

lilacs would pile up on the paths

lord of my soul, pity to gain from you,

love cannot have, than that in loving thee

love fits the soul with wings, and bids her win

love happened at last

love happened at last,

love is

love is not always harsh and deadly sin,

love takes me captive; beauty binds my soul;

love's adjectives into a suitcase

making the semblance of thy face and mine,

march against ugliness,

mary fell in the hands of the militias

matches that of the air,

may be your whole world

may kill a man condemned to mortal pain,

mid snares and pitfalls scattered far and wide;--

mine eyes might fix on the least part of you,

mirrored in thy pure form and delicate,

more beautiful than he has seen of paintings

more tenderly perchance than is my due,

must needs reap grief and garner weeping eyes;

my darling, i have much to say

my heart's loved lord to me desertless given!

my letters to you

my love is a burst of sparks,

my love is a siege,

my lover asks me,

my luck in latest age hath brought me pain,

my mind falls silent and no longer says

my son, who sacrifices himself for his beloved,

my soul can find no stair

my soul felt love, her comrade of the skies,

my wounded heart in armour fancy-wrought,

named gaza,

nay, things that suffer death, quench not the fire

nay, were it mine, that shaggy fleece that stays,

near death, the able man may know

ne'er walked the earth a greater man than he,

never, america,

never, america,

never, america,

new cities, new countries discovered,

no more remains in our hands,

no mortal thing enthralled these longing eyes

nor all the shows of beauty shed around

nor cruelty, nor fortune, nor disdain,

nor described by a literate's feather

nor guide have i; nor know i where to find

nor harbours it in any mortal part,

nor is there aught can move

nor know the way, though some one seems to lead,

nor yet can bear to be from you divided,

not a single concubine remains in our palace,

not love but lawless impulse is desire,

not the peace of the strong and able,

nothing but the color blue

nothing terrifies us any more,

nothing with me,

nothing with me,except words

now there is no star

nurse of his fortunes; and this showeth well

o you who makes of my words through their meaning

of beauties infinite that blind these eyes,

of deathless spirits; nor eternity

of fierce desires that from the passions flow;

of flesh, and soars to where thy splendours glow,

of her celestial home once more doth steal,

of her first maker which the spirit feels;

of him who slakes the thirst that burns within,

of outward change, there blooms a deathless flower,

of revenge against the laws of the tribe,

of such a knot of love, or of such a faith,

of tears through age exceeds in tenderness,

of that bright soul that fires me like the sun,

of you calls forth the end of days,

oh my beloved! nature's like that too,

oh, blessed day when you at last are mine!

oh, my love

oh, would that i might die, for her to find

on stones, and gauged god's reason with his own,

one day i fall in love,

only to gaze exhausts our utmost might,

or a child!!

or arab food,

or arab shame

or arab singing,

or being terrified with the sight of blood,

or blame unequal birth and circumstance;

or else thy face, thine eyes, which stole the hues

or fame or dreams beget that vision bright,

or fault your beauty or demanding will,

or if a time-old memory reveals

or if the mind and memory reveal

or if within the soul the vision bright

or if you are my lover,

or tries to unite her plaits

our friends on earth, fairer in death on high,

our mortal thoughts, could draw mine to the day,

our souls, and doom our flesh to swift decay,

painting their voyage to endlessness,

perchance i might have been less simply blest,

perchance the lord who now holds cruel sway

pity and mercy with their gentle eyes

pride mixed with meekness and kind thoughts that smile,

pure light; and thus i find god's counterpart

raiment in my outworn mortality!

raising the twain from earth to heaven beyond,

ravished by all that to the eyes is fair,

ready to pay the prize - content to die

rejoicing,

rescue me from this ocean

rests on her cheek and throat in happiness!

robbing the loathly worm of its last prey,

run barefoot toward me,

said who

sail-less, on the sea of love

say, can mere angry spite this knot untwine?

saying, this toil will end in happy cheer;

scribbling on the starsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ walls

searching for islands still unborn,

seeing my soul, so lost and ill-betided,

sell all your bracelets,

sense triumphs o'er all adverse impulses,

serves sordid time, that withers all things rare,

seville fell,

she passes , passes , passes by ,

she sat with fear in her eyes

ships laden with turquoise

should a woman

should another give you a cloud

should he give you a branch

should he give you a lantern, i

shut up within an old man's cindery breast?

since if all human loves were impious,

since in thy heart thou carriest death and grace

sliding

snow falls in july,

so friendly is the fire to flinty stone,

so i can give long life to both of us

so i gave,and you gave

so many peerless beauties blent in one,

so sorely that life, strength, and vigour tire,

so terror, which is always near

so that the world escorts me wherever i go ?

so, my loved lord, within thy bosom springs

some other beauty for the heart's delight;

some other beauty for the heart's delight;

sometimes my love i dare to entertain

souls burn for souls, spirits to spirits cry!

source of all joys divine, that comfort us

speak of me to the winding road and the stream

spill over the sea and are not drowned,

stones sing in the night,

such gold, not iron, my spirit strikes and tries,

sweet to the eyes, which through the bosom steals,

teach me,

teach me,

temper the source of this supreme delight,

than petulant desire is wont to gain,

than reach the faintest glory round him shed,

than that i praise thereby the glorious

that as his exile hath no parallel,

that both to one sole end their wills combine;

that breathes on earth the air of paradise,

that burning fire; yet some one seems to lead,

that death should spare perfection so complete?

that dream hath vanished, and my hope is flown;

that has the music of water the message of fire

that hope is true which the pure heart hath known,

that i am here more near to thee to be,

that i may clasp and keep, by grace divine,

that is not perfumed with my fragrance

that is with us day and night

that lets me soar with her to seek god's throne,

that lifts our longing to their highest height

that love hath stolen all my strength away;

that make me forget the dance and the steps

that not one part of me may miss thy sight!

that now reveals her breast, now seems to bind,

that one and the other desire to reach a single end,

that reconciliation which, like a dagger, was thrust into us,

that separates

that slays the soul; our love makes still more fair

that still more pleasing grows with growing use;

that the most perfect most of grief shall see,

that the ocean is very deep,i would not have swam,

that they adorn none other like to thee!

that will be forever the best of fates

that, changing like the snake, i might be free

that, like an eagle gazing on the sun,

that, struck therefrom and kindled to a blaze,

the almond tree and the tulip

the best of artists hath no thought to show

the blue waves,in your eyes

the court clerk's fee was in dollars,

the dews that fall from heaven, though pure and clear,

the diamond ring was in dollars,

the difference, my love,

the east receives my songs, some praise, some curse

the flames of holy worship, nor denies

the grace reserved for those who humbly sue,

the hearts in two chests can burn and tear;

the honor-ravager of the sky?

the hours breathe like puppies,

the ill i shun, the good i seek, even so

the last of our favorites fell

the last walls of shame fell,

the livelong day her dress hath perfect bliss,

the love of that whereof i speak, ascends,

the love wherewith i love thee hath no heart;

the mangoes fall all around, the forests catch fire

the mind that worships what recalls the sun

the one love soars, the other downward tends;

the paragon of all their works to be!

the pillars of the spirit fell,and the branches of the tribe,

the poem more important than the notebook,

the pure ethereal soul surmounts that bar

the rainy weather

the shoes that bear her burden! when the ways

the sky is my intimate,

the sons of the country were absent from the wedding parade,

the soul lights this, while that the senses stir,

the water gushes from my fingers

the way he pleases,

the wedding cake was a gift from america,

the wedding was finished, and palestine was not present at the

the woman you love

the world which we inhabit? better plea

their maker, whom the years to dust return!

then take my hand

then we begot--unfortunately--retarded children

then what are we defending??

there is a woman in your life, my son

there remain no ruins over which we cry

there was no arab dancing at the wedding

there where i loved thee first to dwell for ever,

therefore not love, nor thy transcendent face,

these are my songs and this is me

they are the only documents

they granted us a homeland smaller than a grain of wheat,

they have the form of frogs,

they left in our hands a can of sardines

they left us a body without bones

they silenced the street,

they stole from us the memory of the lemons,

they stole jesus, son of mary,

they stole the doors,

thinking how brief must be an old man's bliss,

this dress is not my dress,

this fair false world her wings to earth have bound,

this fire of love when frosts are wont to reign,

this fire that burns my heart, i cannot find;

this heart of flesh feeds not with life my love,

this light i long for and unguided seek;

this man descended to the doomed and dead

this shame is not my shame,

this short book contains us

this wedding is not my wedding,

this, since i saw thee, lady, makes me weak,

this, since i saw thee, lady, makes me weak;

thou knowest, love, i know that thou dost know

though fired with fervent love, our bodies are,

though i effect the opposite of my design,

though nearly past the setting mid thick cloud

thousands and thousands would not make a hundredth

threatens my life more than that agony,

through the panes, which the snow blurs,

thus all in vain my soul to scape thee flies,

thus thy unwonted kindness shown to me

thus to effect cause yields, art hath her turn,

thy beauty and my sadness shall be shown,

thy beauty is no mortal thing; 'twas sent

till burned and slaked to better life i rise,

till i melt her golden hair

till the worth of love

time from this single moment,

'tis the first step that leads her to the shrine

to an evening of perfumed balconies

to be a book of tears

to beauty, feeds desire strange food,

to blame is easier than those who him offended,

to cast the slough wherein i dwell confined!

to curb the fiery will, the ruffling pride

to each of them my gratitude i bear

to fuel massed like this should make it glow?

to love a woman

to match the fancies that each master brings;

to mount to heaven, save earth's loveliness,

to seek his pleasure and his pain to shun,

to the female who one day ate our children,

to the true good above all mortal sight,

to the woman i loved

tomorrow people will see me in his verse

tomorrow when i return its pages

tongue cannot tell how fair, how pure as day,

too much good luck no less than misery

towards chicago, and jersey, and miami

travels the world

turn into lightning and thunder, a sword, a sandy storm,

under the skin of the water

ungrateful land! to its own prejudice

until she triumphed, and made you,

unto the love of loves aloft she flies,

unto what end did god the world ordain?

verbs, nouns, syntax,

wake in my heart a hope that cannot cheat,

we came out barren,

we clearly read, and are so rare and great

we do not find a homeland to dwell in

we entered the age of haste,

we have no shelter, like thousands of dogs!!,

we ran,and panted,,

we saw the precious pearls of the sea

we see, but cannot climb to clasp a star,

we sit now, on the destroyed land,

we took her on a honeymoon,

weak as myself, he will be whirled away

well may these eyes of mine both near and far

were waiting in your heart, and there my skill

were wet with rain, her feet i then should kiss!

what beauties heaven and nature can create,

what costs the heart so much, must needs be dear!

what cruelty, or late or soon, denies

what fate is mine? who guides or guards my ways,

what hope against this fire more fierce have i?

what i felt for you,

what is the difference between me and the sky?

what joy hath yon glad wreath of flowers that is

what law, what destiny, what fell control,

what lives thenceforward binding stones in one,

what means it then that we are sundered so?

what should be said of him cannot be said;

what so

what thou best lovest, be not therefore stern,

what though long waiting wins more happiness

what use is the haste?

what use is the haste?

what will the force be of a flame more dire

what wonder if the first chance brand applied

what would my arms do in that girdle's place?

what would the world have been if we had not been

wheat grows between the pages of books,

when a man is in love

when first love sent our souls from god above,

when i am sitting at the window,

when i love

when i love

when i love

when i love

when i love a woman

when i love you

when i love you the arab cities leap up and demonstrate

when i love you your breasts shake off their shame,

when perfect peace in thy fair face i found;

when the conscience of the people remains alive

when to old age is added love's unrest?

whence i draw nought, my sad self to beguile,

whence, when i fain would halve my griefs, they weigh

where erring thought or ill desire may move,

where o precious one shall i begin ?

where people will discover

wherefore, though wasting, burning, i'm content;

wherewith against thy beauty to array

which alters not with time or death's decay,

which burns the heart within me, be made known,

which every man or more or less doth feel;

which i live in,for seconds,

which make me a woman,in seconds

which the rough stone in its superfluous shell

which with declining beauty wanes and dies,

while he was still a suckling,

while like a slaughtered bird she cried

who enters her room

who from his country's, closed against him, fled,

who has hidden a thousand poems

who has neither land, nor home

who makes coffee, and sex,

who such divinity to thee imparts

who tried for beauty times untold

who will ask them

who will ask them?

who will ask them??

who, searching sail out to their death,

who, when i die, can lay the blame on thee?

why did he sing these songs ?

will cause her to be lost, my son,lost

will conquer nature;--so divine a power

will give you the moon

wingless, hath cast words to the winds, and dew

with beauty, which is varying every hour;

with double sorrow, and i sink to nought,

with my loved lord, who minds but lies alone;

with my poetry

with one pleasure and one delight, to such a measure

with sculpture, know this well; her wonders live

with soaring hope not over-credulous;

with such delight, such savour, and so well,

with too much rapture bringing light again,

without a country to embrace,

without a roof and without pillars,

without being shaken,or crying,

without intimidation,with symmetry of wish,

woman is different far; the love of her

woman's rebellious heart i have supported

words are not like other words

words,which overturn my history

works adverse to my wish, and lays me low,

woven and wrought into a vestment fair,

wrought in hard mountain marble, will survive

yea, and the belt to such as understand,

yes! hope may with my strong desire keep pace,

yet by that token she is old

yet gives me great delight,

yet hungry for the joys that truly bless,

yet living man that beauty scarce can learn,

yet peradventure though my day is done,--

yet still more blissful seems to me the band

yet why complain? for even now i find

yet with his hands love wipes my weeping eyes,

yet, if but heaven like earth incline to thee,

yielding on earth earnest of paradise,

you are destined to fall in love

you are predestined to sail forever

you can see it in the laughter of doves

you have been pursuing only a trace of smoke

you hold the good i want and pain i fear,

you will ask the shores of the seas

you will ask the waves of the sea about her

you will be great only through my great love

you will find that since your beloved

you will seek her everywhere, my son

you will travel the oceans

you would cast away your jewelry,

you, lady, still my night to noon may turn,

your beauty

your beloved, my son, is sleeping

your life is forever destined

your love is like atheism,so purify me from this atheism

your road blocked, blocked, my son

your spirit sees into my heart, where rise
